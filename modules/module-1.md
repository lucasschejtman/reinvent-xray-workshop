# Module 1 - Integration

Start by reviewing the `app.js` file to understand the bootstrapping process for AWS X-Ray.

Once you're ready, head into the `modules/module-1.js` file and follow the instructions. After the missing code has been implemented, you can deploy the application to start capturing `Module 1` tracing information.
